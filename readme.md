# Oyster Chrome Extension

This Chrome Extension tells you whether or not the current book you're looking at on Amazon is available on [Oyster](://oysterbooks.com). If so, it'll show the Oyster logo in the omnibox and clicking it will take you to the book page on Oyster. Yay!

## Example

## How to Install

**Note:** I'm planning on putting this on the chrome webstore shortly and will include a link there when it's up.

Until then, download this, open up `chrome://extensions` in Chrome and check the `"Developer Mode"` checkbox.

Next, click "Load unpacked extension..." and navigate to this directory. Select that, and you should be good to go.
